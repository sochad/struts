					Master of Science in Computer Science is a breadth-based program. Students are required to complete 30 credits of graduate courses.<br/>
					Courses are grouped in the following five broad areas: 
					<li>Artificial Intelligence and Databases</li>
					<li>Programming Languages and Software Engineering</li>
					<li>Systems and Networks</li>
					<li>Theoretical Computer Science</li>
					<li>Visual Computing</li>
				</ol>
				<li>Masters of Science in Information Systems</li>
				<ol>To provide a common background in the fundamentals of information systems, four core courses are required of all students.<br/>
				Six elective courses may be within an emphasis area or according to students' professional interests.<br/>
				Four core courses (12 credits) are required of all IS graduates:<br/>
				<li>INFS 612   Principles and Practices of Communication Networks</li>
				<li>INFS 614   Database Management</li>
				<li>INFS 622   Information Systems Analysis and Design</li>
				<li>ISA 562    Information Security Theory and Practice</li>
				
				</ol>
				<li>Masters of Science in Software Engineering</li>
				<ol>
					Four core courses are required of all MS-SWE graduates:

				<li>SWE 619   Object-Oriented Software Specification and Construction </li>
				<li>SWE 621   Software Modeling and Architectural Design</li>
				<li>SWE 622   Distributed Software Engineering</li>
				<li>SWE 637   Software Testing</li>

				
				</ol>
				<li>Masters of Science in Information Security and Assurance</li>
				<ol>To provide the necessary background and fundamentals of information systems security and assurance, the program has three courses that are required of all students:
					<li>ISA 562 Information Security Theory and Practice</li>
